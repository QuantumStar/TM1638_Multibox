# TM1638_Multibox
This is a small desk toy I made to put the TM1638 keypad / display to use. Includes 8-bit Binary to Decimal converter. Originally written to fit onto an ATMega328P, it could probably be optimized to use less memory and include more features.

Uses the TM1638Plus library. SongPlayer portion and songs are from code found here: https://codebender.cc/sketch:238461#Songs%20on%20Piezo.ino Binary converter and other code written by me.

(Will include schematic for the device later, but it's not complicated to figure out from the code.)
